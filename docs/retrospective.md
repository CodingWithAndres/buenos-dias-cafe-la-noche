# Project Retrospective  
**Project Name:** Buenos Días Café x La Noche  

## What Went Well  
Organizing the repo early made everything smoother. Writing the docs first helped guide the site build. Publishing to GitHub Pages worked on the first try.  

## What Went Wrong  
Time management was tricky with other deadlines. I fixed small CSS and link errors after testing.  

## What I’d Do Differently  
Start earlier, sketch layouts first, and check accessibility sooner.  
Overall, this project helped me combine planning, writing, and web design in a clear final result.
